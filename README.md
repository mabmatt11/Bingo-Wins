# Bingo-Wins
Early self project in discovering, on average, on what pull of a bingo game will somebody win based on how many people are playing.

Created and used on Eclipse. Running BingoAve.java will prompt the user asking how many people are in the game then will run 1000 simulations before outputting data.
